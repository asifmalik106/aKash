# aKash #
aKash is a CLI based demo Mobile Financial Service(MFS) application. This is my first project when I was in my 1st semester in my university. At that time, I just started learning programming and how it works. The objective of making this application is to experiment and play with my programming knowledge. 

# Background
I was inspired by a USSD based mobile financial service(MFS) [bKash](http://www.bkash.com/)
