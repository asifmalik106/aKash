# aKash #
aKash is a CLI based demo Mobile Financial Service(MFS) application. This is my first project when I was in my 1st semester in my university. At that time, I just started learning programming and how it works. The objective of making this application is to experiment and play with my programming knowledge. 

### **Background** ###
This project is inspired by an USSD based mobile financial service(MFS) [bKash](http://www.bkash.com/). [bKash](http://www.bkash.com/) (Bengali: বিকাশ) is a mobile financial service in Bangladesh operating under the authority of [Bangladesh Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Bank) as a subsidiary of [BRAC Bank Limited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRAC_Bank_Limited). bKash users can deposit money into their mobile accounts and then access a range of services, in particular transferring and receiving money domestically, making payments and can recharge prepaid mobiles easily. Also, They can pay mobile postpaid bills. In April 2013, International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, became an equity partner, in March 2014, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation became an investor in the company, and in April 2018 Ant Financial, the operators of Alipay (a concern of Chinese giant Alibaba Group), became an equity partner.
